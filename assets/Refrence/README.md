# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm) by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner x
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down x
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day x
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a timeblock x
THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock x
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page x
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
